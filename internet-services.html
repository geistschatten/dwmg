					<h3>Retargeting & Display Advertising</h3>
					<p>Display Advertising is not new to the Internet. With new innovative technologies, improved reporting and analytics, and proven strategies – re-targeted display advertising has seen a huge resurgence for online advertisers. The average click-through rate on re-targeted ads is 10x greater than regular display ads.</p><p>Retargeting brings people, who left without converting or making a purchase, back to your website and turns them into customers. When an online shopper visits your site, and for whatever reason decides to not make a purchase or act on your call-to-action, retargeting keeps your business in front of them as they browse other sites.</p>
